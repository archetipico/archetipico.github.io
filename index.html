                    <h1>Biography</h1>
                    <p>
                        Since 1997, I've called <b>Milan</b> my home, cherishing its unique culture and dynamic changes over the years.
                        I attended a <b>Scientific Lyceum</b>, where I had the opportunity to present a thesis on the intersection of malwares and art.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, as I approach the completion of my studies in <b>Computer Science</b> from Universita' degli Studi di Milano, drafting a thesis that focuses on developing a visual language tailored for the semantic annotation of web tables.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my professional journey, I've dedicated myself, since 2017, to my role as a <b>Systems Analyst</b>, where I had the opportunity to contribute to both the production and testing of a cloud-based software designed for document management.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have a keen interest in <b>Information Security</b> and <b>Scientific Visualization</b>. In my free time, I enjoy studying <b>Computer Graphics</b> and exploring various other hobbies.

                            This Bash-coded toolkit is a handy asset for UNIX systems. Upon installation, just type `up` to update everything.

                            Here are a few tables (in Italian) to remind me to consume seasonal foods, with a focus on their climate impact.

                            While Windows 10 does not inherently support the feature to change your wallpaper according to the time of day, this script can accomplish the task.
